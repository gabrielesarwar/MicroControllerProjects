# MicroControllerProjects
Knowledge of the fundamental concepts of embedded systems, event-driven programming and real-time programming. experience applying these concepts by implementing small-scale programs on a sample microcontroller platform equipped with a variety of peripheral devices such as LED’s, LCD’s, Joystick, accelerometer and Servo motors. I used concepts such as interrupts, systick and analog to digital.
